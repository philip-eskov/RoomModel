# RoomModel
Simple simulation of acoustic waves propagating in a room. 

The original code was written by me at the University of Oslo course FYS2130 Oscillations and Waves. This was a part of my "computational essay" for the course, in which I simulated the propagation of acoustic plane waves in a room with different objects of varying sound speeds. This was a very fun project, so much so that I want to continue working on it (and iron out some of the bugs that I know are there).
